		    <p><strong>Mario:</strong> &ldquo;Mario has always been a playable character. In games where characters are divided into weight groups, Mario is always a middleweight character. Numerous tracks throughout the series have been called Mario Circuit, or something with the name &quot;Mario&quot; in it.&rdquo; (wiki)</p>

		    <p><strong>Princess Peach:</strong> Princess Peach is a playable character in all ten of the Mario Kart installments. Peach is the love-interest of Mario. She is also friends with Daisy, Luigi, Toad, and Toadette. She has an infant counterpart known as Baby Peach in Mario Kart Wii. Baby Peach is basically the infant form of Peach, but she wears a tutu, sucks on a pacifier, and wears a diaper. She serves as the lead female in the Mario series.

            <p><strong>Browser:</strong> Bowser is an incredibly strong Koopa and is twice the size of Koopa Troopa. His body is a dark yellow, and his bulky arms and legs end in razor sharp spikes. That's why no one wants to shake his hand. His tale is also spiky, and on his neck, shoulders and wrists are four black bands with silver spikes lining them. His mouth is full of sharp teeth, and large horns come out of his green head. He has a fiery orange mane, and on his back is a giant green shell with numerous spikes lining it. Bowser loves spikes. Bowser has a deep, growling voice, and he can shoot fire balls from his mouth.  (http://mariokart.wikia.com/wiki/Bowser) </p>
